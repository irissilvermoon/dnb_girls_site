    <p>A self-proclaimed "Mad Scientist" on the decks, Corrine puts the MIX back into DJing. This East Bay native only DJs her own edits, showing no track any mercy, giving her a no BS style that will always keep you guessing and begging for more.</p> <p>She comes from a classically trained musical background, a punk rock past, and a sick obsession with pop culture, making her DJ sets nothing short of epic. Corrine is a trained hip hop dancer, studied saxophone and percussion in college, and even spent some time doing freelance rock journalism in Los Angeles. This girl can geek out with the best of them.</p> <p>She has a vast knowledge of old school Hip Hop & Pop music, which allows her to please even the most basic club goer's urge to get down. Disco obsessed and procuring a never-ending influence from Breakbeat music, she makes everything that comes out of the speakers something funky. </p> <p>She has gone on tour playing Moombahton & Dubstep. Her Booty Bass & Trap music sets will put to shame even the most hardcore Bros on the decks. In House & Electro, she nails the art of eb and flow, bringing people to climax with the most epic melodies and filthiest baselines around.</p> <p>Everywhere she goes she dazzles audiences with her ability to mix. But recently she really found her calling when she tackled the world of Drum & Bass. From Jungle to Jump-Up, Liquid to Ragga, this badass lady doesn't mess around when it comes to DnB. Opening for such acts as, APHRODITE, MOB TACTICS, FOREIGN CONCEPT, RANDOM MOVEMENT, MSDOS, ANDY C and PENDULUM just to name a few.</p> <p>Whether it's her love of rolling baselines or her ear for syncopated drumbeats, she delivers an engaging range of music, schooling even the most elite music lovers. Whatever the genre, she never hesitates to bring the house down wherever she goes. </p> <p>In Early 2015, she teamed up with Drum and Bass diva Miss Haze to form the super duo BITCH PLZ making a dynamic stage show that is in high demand. She currently holds residencies with the Drum & Bass monthly DYSTOPIA and SHELTER, the longest running DnB weekly in the bay, as well as taking the reigns at the Castro in San Fransiscoâ€™s Qbar, for TURNT THURSDAYS, co-hosting nights with her partner, full of booty shaking Ghouse and teched out funky rhythms. You can find her being fresh and funky at the newest of her residencies with Bitch Plz, at DISCO DONUTZ, representing Drum and Bass at this muti-genre, costumed out, day party monthly.</p> <p>She rocks a STAR WARS tattoo which makes her hard to miss, she is "The Rebel With The Treble," and she rocks every party dropping mad science on the dance floor.</p>
