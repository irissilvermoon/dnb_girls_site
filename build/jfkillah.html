    <p>With a love for underground sounds, an affinity for dark grimy basslines, and a passion for making people dance, J.F.Killah is on a mission to spread her sounds worldwide. A true junglist at heart, this bass diva has played a key role in maintaining the vitality of the DnB scene in Vancouver, BC. As a member of SHAHdjs and DnB Girls, she has been rocking the decks since 2005. Her unrelenting skills have earned her opening slots for the likes of Camo and Krooked, Loadstar, Netsky, Dirty Phonics, Shimon, Datsik, and S.P.Y to name a few. She has graced the decks in Europe, New Zealand, United States, South America and performed at several Canadian festivals including Shambhala and Bass Coast. With training on the keys and in music theory she is able to utilize her understanding of key, emotion, and the power of sound to provide her audience with musically dynamic performances time after time. You can expect to hear a wide range of genres with a healthy dose of DnB/Jungle in her sets. Currently focused on production, she plans on having releases on major labels in the next few years. Get ready for murdah because the Killah slays it every time!</p>
