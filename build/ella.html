    <p>The behind the scenes backbone of the now defunct Montreal Drum’n’Bass label Metaphor Recordings (2002-2004) Ella Grave got her real first break recording back-up for feisty local female MC Dee (Atach Tatuq, Deluxxx, 2005). From there, Ella was invited to join the Hardsteppers band alongside Sase One (aka Bankster), Adam L, Kali and Regimental Oneton. When the Hardsteppers went on hiatus in September of 2008, Ella Grave connected with young local Dubstep up and comer DJ/Producer Wally and started gigging for a few years as Wally and MC Gen. Their partnership grew more and more solid and with the summer of 2009 came a big, bright, bold idea to fuse all available elements and put together a live Dubstep band, adding live drummer Pleckobwoy to the blossoming duo. Flash forward to 2012, and Risk (“Montreal’s premier live dubstep band”) has had the awesome opportunity to play in various showcases opening for Dub FX and High Tone, working with Monkey Dub and sharing the stage with Construct (including being featured as JLD’s podcast #173), Wyld Stallyns, Vilify (at the ever ridiculously off the chain Bassdrive Wednesdays), The Masterfaders, Crimewave, Bus (E.S.L.), Elo!i And Heights, Glitchy&Scratchy, Geoff Bukk, Linvingstone and Gulf Stream, to name a few. In August of 2011, Ella was introduced to By-ron and the 2 quickly started composing brand new original material under the name Low-ki. Their 1st full fledge album called Songs in the key of low is due out November 2012. </p> <p>Having just joined the amazingly talented DNB Girls of Canada collective as an official emcee, these days Ella Grave is absolutely honored and hard at work cooking up some bass heavy productions lovingly reppin her hometown of Montreal, Québec and preparing for DNB Girl world domination, with a French twist </p>
