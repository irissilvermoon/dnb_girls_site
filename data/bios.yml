  bio: >
    <p>Iris was introduced to electronic music at age 13, when she first heard “Insomnia” by Faithless on Seattle’s C89.5. Since then, her love affair with the music has only intensified as she has honed a diverse set of tastes and an equally exacting repertoire of skills behind the decks. Her journey has taken her from UK Hard House, into the sounds of Trance and Progressive, finally culminating in her current focus of Deep Drum and Bass, Techno.</p>
    <p>Iris has recently started collaborating on original productions with DnB veteran Quadrant. Their first tune, Anthropocene, was spotted immediately by none other than Goldie himself, and snapped up for the Metalheadz Genesis EP volume 4. Other collaborations, with Quadrant and local legend Kid Hops, have been picked up and supported by Total Science for their CIA imprint, as well as Hospital Recordings, and Italian label Avantgarde.</p>
    <p>With an ever growing arsenal of original productions, a host of exclusive tunes from the hottest producers around the world, all held down by meticulous mixing and track selection, Iris is a force to be reckoned with.</p>

  bio: >
    <p>If a line exists between classical and electronic, between ancient and new age, synthetic and organic, Kytami has sliced them all using only a violin bow... but what more does she need?
      Apparently nothing at all, as Kytami has already been dubbed a 'music revolutionary' by Whats Up Magazine USA, a 'violinistextremist' here at home, and has been summoned to bring her violin thunder to audiences as far reaching as Taiwan, Dubai and Berlin.
      Through an alchemy of classical, fiddle styles fused with the heavy bass elements of Dubstep and Hip Hop, Kytami has managed to soar above not only the constraints of musical genre and labeling, but has forged a path so bold and unique that it's taken her alongside groups from Swollen Members to acoustic punk rockers Blackie and The Triumphs and today she is regularly dubbed Canada's most diverse and engaging fiddle player.</p>
    <p>After co-founding the critically acclaimed global-fusion sound-storm Delhi 2 Dublin in 2006 and subsequently co-songwriting them toward international musical success until 2010, Kytami surged forward with her own solo career, bringing the essence of her music to audiences in its purest possible form. The 2012 release of her eponymous full-length solo album made this a reality by combining the far flung elements of Classical Music, Dubstep, and the world that only Kytami knows. In 2013 she won “Live Act of The Year” at the Vancouver Island Music Awards and “Electronic/Dance Recording of the Year” at the 2013 Western Canadian Music Awards.</p>
    <p>With all this enigma, what can you expect at a Kytami show? Well lets start by straightening that out actually, the girl doesn't play shows, she detonates dance floors. Whether in front of Delhi 2 Dublin or Turntablist “The PhonoGraff”, Kytami is internationally renowned for one thing: she rocks the fiddle like a woman possessed... and the audience dances to match.
      From Germany to Hong Kong and Joshua Tree Festival to Shambhala, one thing is affirmed at Kytami concerts time and again: If you dare witness this violin diva take the stage, be prepared to wear through not only the soles of your dancing shoes, but perhaps the version of reality you brought to the door.</p>

  bio: >
    <p>The behind the scenes backbone of the now defunct Montreal Drum’n’Bass label Metaphor Recordings (2002-2004) Ella Grave got her real first break recording back-up for feisty local female MC Dee (Atach Tatuq, Deluxxx, 2005). From there, Ella was invited to join the Hardsteppers band alongside Sase One (aka Bankster), Adam L, Kali and Regimental Oneton. When the Hardsteppers went on hiatus in September of 2008, Ella Grave connected with young local Dubstep up and comer DJ/Producer Wally and started gigging for a few years as Wally and MC Gen. Their partnership grew more and more solid and with the summer of 2009 came a big, bright, bold idea to fuse all available elements and put together a live Dubstep band, adding live drummer Pleckobwoy to the blossoming duo. Flash forward to 2012, and Risk (“Montreal’s premier live dubstep band”) has had the awesome opportunity to play in various showcases opening for Dub FX and High Tone, working with Monkey Dub and sharing the stage with Construct (including being featured as JLD’s podcast #173), Wyld Stallyns, Vilify (at the ever ridiculously off the chain Bassdrive Wednesdays), The Masterfaders, Crimewave, Bus (E.S.L.), Elo!i And Heights, Glitchy&Scratchy, Geoff Bukk, Linvingstone and Gulf Stream, to name a few. In August of 2011, Ella was introduced to By-ron and the 2 quickly started composing brand new original material under the name Low-ki. Their 1st full fledge album called Songs in the key of low is due out November 2012. </p>
    <p>Having just joined the amazingly talented DNB Girls of Canada collective as an official emcee, these days Ella Grave is absolutely honored and hard at work cooking up some bass heavy productions lovingly reppin her hometown of Montreal, Québec and preparing for DNB Girl world domination, with a French twist </p>

  bio: >
    <p>At the age of only seventeen, Distinct, a newcomer to the electronic music scene, was quickly infatuated with the sounds of Drum & Bass. It wasn’t long before hearing the fast paced genre that she was out purchasing her first pieces of vinyl. Due to an extensive musical background it was only a matter of time before she was dabbling in a variety of other genres including glitch-hop, funky bass, breaks and electro house. Her versatility and ear for top notch electronica has landed her numerous gigs across Alberta and British Columbia.</p>
    <p>Eager to share her music and support her local scene she got herself involved with The Supreme Hustle, a local crew. With them and a few other collectives, she currently helps to promote, perform and aid in the success of their popular events featuring the likes of Logistics, Metrik, S.P.Y. and Xilent to name a few.</p>
    <p>After placing 4th in "Calgary's Next Top DJ" and an interview and article in djmag.ca, she caught the attention of the scouts from the Drum & Bass Girls. It was no surprise they’d soon be asking her to join the team of women making noise across the country. With an already extensive festival circuit, a dream to conquer the world, and a family of experienced and supportive female artists to back her, there is no stopping this ball of D&B fire, as this is only the beginning of a very promising career.</p>

    <p>Born into a family of musicians and passionate music lovers, music has been a huge part of Lovelace's life since day one. Lovelace fell in love with electronic music in the late 90's and began DJ'ing in 2000 playing throughout Central California. Lovelace joined forces with Matos in the San Francisco Bay Area in 2011. Their creative synergy and mutual love of Drum & Bass and Jungle music was a powerful force that could not be ignored. Lovelace pushes the sound hard and has played at some of the largest DnB nights in the US including Respect LA; Stamina SF; United D&B, Substructure, & Torque in Florida; BP², Natural Selection, NYC Jump Up!, and Konkrete Jungle in New York City; Sub.mission in Denver; Organized Grime in San Diego. Lovelace has shared the stage with international artists such as Top Cat, Liondub, Heist, Sub Zero, Marcus Visionary, Cyantific, Ricky Force, and more, as well as much American talent. In 2015 Matos & Lovelace expanded their reach with shows in Costa Rica & Hong Kong, China, as well as a guest appearance on the mighty KoolLondon.com. Lovelace takes pride in excellent mixing skills and unique selection flow that always takes the dancefloor on a powerful journey through the sounds of DnB and Jungle music, whether playing to seasoned junglists or fresh ears alike.</p>
    <p>While living on Maui in 2012 / 2013, Lovelace pushed the DnB & Jungle sound as an independent DJ as well as an original resident of Sub.mission Hawaii, a subchapter of Sub.mission Denver. Later Matos joined her on the island and they launched Destination Jungle as a platform for the sound on Maui, hosting US and international talent such as Marcus Visionary, Ben Soundscape, Calculon, Jaybee & Tankman. After relocating to the New York area in 2014, they also expanded Destination Jungle to a radio show, where they and special guests spread the sound worldwide. In 2015 Lovelace became a member of DnB Girls, and Matos + Lovelace were welcomed into the renowned BP² crew in NYC. Now their creative synergy is going to the next level... the recording studio! Stay tuned…</p>

    <p>A self-proclaimed "Mad Scientist" on the decks, Corrine puts the MIX back into DJing. This East Bay native only DJs her own edits, showing no track any mercy, giving her a no BS style that will always keep you guessing and begging for more.</p>
    <p>She comes from a classically trained musical background, a punk rock past, and a sick obsession with pop culture, making her DJ sets nothing short of epic. Corrine is a trained hip hop dancer, studied saxophone and percussion in college, and even spent some time doing freelance rock journalism in Los Angeles. This girl can geek out with the best of them.</p>
    <p>She has a vast knowledge of old school Hip Hop & Pop music, which allows her to please even the most basic club goer's urge to get down. Disco obsessed and procuring a never-ending influence from Breakbeat music, she makes everything that comes out of the speakers something funky. </p>
    <p>She has gone on tour playing Moombahton & Dubstep. Her Booty Bass & Trap music sets will put to shame even the most hardcore Bros on the decks. In House & Electro, she nails the art of eb and flow, bringing people to climax with the most epic melodies and filthiest baselines around.</p>
    <p>Everywhere she goes she dazzles audiences with her ability to mix. But recently she really found her calling when she tackled the world of Drum & Bass. From Jungle to Jump-Up, Liquid to Ragga, this badass lady doesn't mess around when it comes to DnB. Opening for such acts as, APHRODITE, MOB TACTICS, FOREIGN CONCEPT, RANDOM MOVEMENT, MSDOS, ANDY C and PENDULUM just to name a few.</p>
    <p>Whether it's her love of rolling baselines or her ear for syncopated drumbeats, she delivers an engaging range of music, schooling even the most elite music lovers. Whatever the genre, she never hesitates to bring the house down wherever she goes. </p>
    <p>In Early 2015, she teamed up with Drum and Bass diva Miss Haze to form the super duo BITCH PLZ making a dynamic stage show that is in high demand. She currently holds residencies with the Drum & Bass monthly DYSTOPIA and SHELTER, the longest running DnB weekly in the bay, as well as taking the reigns at the Castro in San Fransisco’s Qbar, for TURNT THURSDAYS, co-hosting nights with her partner, full of booty shaking Ghouse and teched out funky rhythms. You can find her being fresh and funky at the newest of her residencies with Bitch Plz, at DISCO DONUTZ, representing Drum and Bass at this muti-genre, costumed out, day party monthly.</p>
    <p>She rocks a STAR WARS tattoo which makes her hard to miss, she is "The Rebel With The Treble," and she rocks every party dropping mad science on the dance floor.</p>

    <p>Danielle aka kiD-Dee, is one of Calgary/ Los Angeles up and coming Drum and Bass artists to be on the lookout for. Having moved to Calgary from Grande Prairie in 2012, kiD-Dee quickly found her home in this cities iconic DnB scene as a diehard Junglist among the best of them. After falling in love even deeper with the sounds of Drum and Bass she naturally evolved the desire to want to create her own sounds based off the experiences from the amazing live shows she attended, and the musical preferences she had acquired along her journey. After jamming once with some of her best girlfriends she knew this was an activity she would love to do in her free time. She worked hard at completing her very own studio now she could start practicing at home. Which after only a year lead her to making her very own mixes. The quality and finesse behind these mixes quickly got the attention of many acquaintances in her community leading her to many exciting opportunities on the horizon. Keep your eyes open for kiD-Dee both behind the decks and on the dance floor and perhaps even at your favourite festivals. 2018 proves to be a big year for this lil freshy and we are certain kiD-Dee will continue to impress us with the progression of both her skills, style and awesome attitude.
