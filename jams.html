    <p>As general manager of the DnB Girls organization; a collective that pushes the sound of accomplished female artists across the globe, and the main lady of DnB Lives Here; a group of folks committed to growing and advancing DnB music culture across Canada, Jams has been holding things down in her community as a boss lady of DnB. Although passionate about Drum and Bass versatility does not pass her by. While focused mainly on jungle influenced sounds she actively explores every angle of the bass music spectrum keeping her listeners on their toes and her dance floors on fiyah. Having placed 3rd out of 40 participants in her first ever DJ competition only 6 months into her DJ career she subsequently went onto becoming the top female DJ in Edmonton before making her way out east. This talented lady held her own in the big bass leagues of Montreal both solo and as one half of the Dj Duo Master- Faders, who collectively pushed Jungle Bass Music to the next level. Having toured the country playing every major musical city in Canada Jams is now fresh off a recent move to Calgary where she has been rostered with the 403DnB crew and has plans to continue spreading the Drum and Bass and Jungle vibes nationwide.</p>
