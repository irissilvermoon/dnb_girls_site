    <p>At the age of only seventeen, Distinct, a newcomer to the electronic music scene, was quickly infatuated with the sounds of Drum & Bass. It wasn’t long before hearing the fast paced genre that she was out purchasing her first pieces of vinyl. Due to an extensive musical background it was only a matter of time before she was dabbling in a variety of other genres including glitch-hop, funky bass, breaks and electro house. Her versatility and ear for top notch electronica has landed her numerous gigs across Alberta and British Columbia.</p> <p>Eager to share her music and support her local scene she got herself involved with The Supreme Hustle, a local crew. With them and a few other collectives, she currently helps to promote, perform and aid in the success of their popular events featuring the likes of Logistics, Metrik, S.P.Y. and Xilent to name a few.</p> <p>After placing 4th in "Calgary's Next Top DJ" and an interview and article in djmag.ca, she caught the attention of the scouts from the Drum & Bass Girls. It was no surprise they’d soon be asking her to join the team of women making noise across the country. With an already extensive festival circuit, a dream to conquer the world, and a family of experienced and supportive female artists to back her, there is no stopping this ball of D&B fire, as this is only the beginning of a very promising career.</p>
